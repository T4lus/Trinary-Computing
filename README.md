# Trinary-Computing

here is the trello about the current Dev : https://trello.com/b/lH9pM96o/trinary-dev

Ask me gitter to get involved in this project

## About Ternary
Yes - No - Maybe? this is how many people think and it has been said that the human brain is a ternary device. 

Ternary is also used in quantum computing to describe the state of an electron and its spin. 
Ternary systems are nothing new and you only need to look at the Setun, to find more information on a functional ternary computer. Constructed in 1958 in USSR this machine was one of the few functional devices, sadly this machine did not survive to the present day.


In this project we will use balanced Trinary with TUF notation
T -> True
U -> Unknow
F -> False
